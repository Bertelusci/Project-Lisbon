                    <h2>Why travel to Lisbon?</h2>
                    <h3>Lisbon, the city of light</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lisboa is a historic capital, a potpourri of unusual character and charm, where 800 years of
                        cultural
                        influences mingle
                        with modern trends and life styles creating spectacular contrasts.
                        In fact, Lisbon was designated a European City of Culture in 1994, and in 1998 it hosted the
                        World‚Äôs
                        Fair (Expo ‚Äô98).
                        Despite modernization, Lisbon in many ways retains the air of a 19th-century city. The varinas
                        (fish
                        vendors) who roam
                        the streets dressed in long black skirts still carry their wares in baskets on their heads.
                        Vessels
                        tie
                        up at quays
                        where the clang of trolley cars blends with ships‚Äô horns. At dawn, fishing boats deposit their
                        catch
                        for
                        noisy auction
                        with Lisbon shop owners while the fish vendors wait to fill the baskets they peddle through the
                        streets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The general outlines of the city remain as they have for hundreds of years. Lisbon is still a
                        city
                        of
                        balconies and
                        vistas. Some of the most striking of the latter can be seen from the miradouros, the terraces
                        maintained
                        by the
                        municipality on seven of its hillsides. (Many Lisboetas, as the people of Lisbon are known,
                        profess
                        their city to have
                        seven traditional hills, like Rome.) For centuries Lisboetas have discussed the symptoms of an
                        affliction they believe
                        to be endemic in their city: saudade (‚Äúmelancholy‚Äù), a state of anxiety tempered by fatalism
                        that is
                        said to be
                        reflected in fado (‚Äúfate‚Äù), the melodic but deeply emotional folk songs that can still be heard
                        in
                        specific restaurants,
                        mainly in the historic quarters of Alfama and Bairro Alto.

                    <p>
                        Ol√°! My name is Ana and I've been living in Lisbon my whole life. Lisbon is a city full with
                        light
                        and love. Our food is delicious and there are amazing places to visit, either in the city,
                        nature,
                        or beach. I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes to develop my coding skills.
